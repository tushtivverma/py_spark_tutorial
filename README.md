# PySpark Tutorial

This tutorial provides an introduction to using PySpark, a powerful tool for big data processing in Python. The tutorial walks you through the installation of PySpark, setting up a Spark session, and performing basic data manipulation and analysis tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. This tutorial is designed to work with Python 3.x.

## Installation

To run this tutorial, you will need to install PySpark. The necessary steps are included within the Jupyter notebook, but you can also manually install PySpark by running:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook**: Start by opening the Jupyter notebook (`pyspark_tutorial_1.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment.
2. **Follow the Steps**: The notebook is structured to guide you step-by-step through the process of setting up PySpark, creating a Spark session, and performing data analysis.
3. **Run the Cells**: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook contains code blocks that install necessary libraries, import required modules, and run PySpark operations.

## Dataset

This tutorial uses several datasets that are located in the `dataset` folder. These datasets are used for different parts of the analysis.

- **Dataset 1 (test1.csv)**: Contains basic information about individuals, including their names, ages, and years of experience.
- **Dataset 2 (test2.csv)**: Includes additional information with salary data, providing a more comprehensive view of the individuals.
- **Dataset 3 (test3.csv)**: Similar to Dataset 2 but may represent a different version or sample of the data.
- **Dataset 4 (test4.csv)**: Focuses on the departmental allocation and corresponding salaries of individuals.

Make sure these datasets are located in the `dataset` folder at the root level of this project. The notebook assumes this location for loading the data.
